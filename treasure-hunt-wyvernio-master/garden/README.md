# Garden

It's a beautiful garden, but doesn't seem to have any evidence that treasure is here (``ls`` only showed this file, ``README.md``) Maybe we should try the house!

Type ``pwd`` to print the path to where you are now. You will see we are in command-line-treasure-hunt/garden.

Try ``cd ..`` to move up a directory, and then try to ``cd house`` to move into the house directory instead.

```
cd ..
cd house
ls
cat README.md
```
