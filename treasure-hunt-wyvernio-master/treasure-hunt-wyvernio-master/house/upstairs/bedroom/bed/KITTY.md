# It's a kitty!

You found a KITTY.md in the bed/ directory! How soft and cuddly. Congratulations!

But it looks lonely. Why don't you make it a DOGGIE.md here in bed/? Use the ``touch`` command to create a new, empty file. Use the atom text editor (or any editor of your choice) to edit the file.

```
touch DOGGIE.md
atom
```
